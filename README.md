# CSARCH2: Simulation Project - Cache Simulator (Full Associative / LRU)

A simulation of a full-associative CPU cache using the least recently used (LRU) cache replacement policy.

The parameters that can be entered are as follows:

**Block Size —** The size of each memory block in bytes

**Main Memory Size —** The size of the main memory in bytes

**Cache Memory Size —** The size of the cache in bytes

**Memory Access Time —** The amount of time in nanoseconds required to access a memory block from the main memory

**Cache Access Time —** The amount of time in nanoseconds required to access a memory block from the cache

**Add Value(s) to Memory —** The cache block numbers to be accessed. Separate each entry with commas

**Sequence Number —** The amount of times to access the nth memory block. Separate each entry with commas

# Process
Output:
- Number of cache hits
- Number of cache miss
- Miss penalty
- Average memory access time
- Snapshot of the cache memory
- Option to output result to .txt file
# Instructions
1. Go to https://jasgayamo.github.io/CSARCH2-G3-SimulationProject/
2. Fill the memory size, select size category, fill in access time, times to add the sequence
3. Add values (each value must be separated by comma)
4. Press simulate
