# CSARCH2: Simulation Project - Cache Simulator (Full Associative / LRU)

A simulation of a full-associative CPU cache using the least recently used (LRU) cache replacement policy.

The parameters that can be entered are as follows:

**Block Size —** The size of each memory block in bytes

**Main Memory Size —** The size of the main memory in bytes

**Cache Memory Size —** The size of the cache in bytes

**Memory Access Time —** The amount of time in nanoseconds required to access a memory block from the main memory

**Cache Access Time —** The amount of time in nanoseconds required to access a memory block from the cache

**Add Value(s) to Memory —** The cache block numbers to be accessed. Separate each entry with commas

**Sequence Number —** The amount of times to access the nth memory block. Separate each entry with commas
